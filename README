Very simple gem to connect to the TypeForm API for a specified form ID with a valid API key. 

Specify the structure for the hash (model) to be returned. 

Usage: 

Typeform.retrieve_results form_id, api_key, since, ssl_certificate_location

Set since to nil to retrieve all results. 

SSL certificate location defaults to false (none)

To Do: 
- Does not currently deal with what happens if the response fails
- Fails if SSL certificate location is set, not yet implemented
- Ignores all data in the typeform response except for the actual answers (meta data, response ID, etc)
